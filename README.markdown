# Typewriter

This is a simple JavaScript "app" that emulates the look and feel of an old
school typewriter. It uses simple JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (but will
probably move to a Canvas element).

I used the following @font-face fonts:

- [Tex Gyre Cursor](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/TeX-Gyre-Cursor)
- [My Underwood](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/My-Underwood)
